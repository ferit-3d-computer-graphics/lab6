# Lab 6: Animation, Time Series, and Dynamic Scenes

---

Learning objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Animate 3D objects using time series data or frame-based logic.
- Create and visualize 2D and 3D vector fields that evolve over time.
- Apply and synchronize model transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) in animated scenes.
- Update 3D scenes dynamically in response to simulation or user-defined data.

# How to run notebook? 

Unfortunately, k3d extensions for Google Colab are in experimental phase, therefore you probably won't be able to run notebook on Google Colab
(widgets won't appear). 

# Installing Anaconda üêç and Running JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks

Follow these steps to install Anaconda and run your Python notebooks using either **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator** from your Start Menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).
2. From the Navigator interface, you can launch:
   - **Jupyter Notebook**
   - **JupyterLab**

## Step 3: Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook (Terminal method)

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Linux).
2. Your default web browser will open and show the interface.

---

## Step 4: Open and Run a Notebook

1. In the browser interface (Lab or Notebook), **navigate to the folder** containing your `.ipynb` file.
2. Click on the notebook to open it.
3. Run the cells using:
   - **Shift + Enter** to execute a cell.
   - The **"Run"** button in the toolbar.
